Visualization:

DataStructuresVisualizer(): Initialize an empty data structures visualizer.

visualize_linked_list(ll): Visualize a linked list graphically.

visualize_stack(stack): Visualize a stack graphically.

visualize_queue(queue): Visualize a queue graphically.
DataStructuresVisualizer(): Initialize an instance of the Data Structures Visualizer, providing a platform for graphical representation.

This class serves as the foundation for visualizing various data structures, facilitating an interactive and educational experience.

Upon instantiation, the DataStructuresVisualizer is ready to depict the inner workings of linked lists, stacks, queues, and more in a clear and engaging manner.
visualize_linked_list(ll): Render a graphical representation of the provided linked list (ll), offering a visual insight into its structure.

This method generates a graphical illustration that visually depicts the nodes and connections within the linked list, aiding in a better understanding of its organization.

By calling visualize_linked_list(ll), users can observe the dynamic nature of linked lists, enhancing their comprehension of this fundamental data structure.
visualize_stack(stack): Generate a graphical representation of the given stack (stack), providing a visual depiction of its elements and their order.

This visualization method creates an illustrative display showcasing the LIFO (Last In, First Out) nature of stacks, enabling users to grasp the push and pop operations visually.

By utilizing visualize_stack(stack), learners can observe how items are added and removed from the stack, enhancing their understanding of this fundamental data structure.
visualize_queue(queue): Produce a graphical representation of the specified queue (queue), offering a visual portrayal of its elements and their sequential arrangement.

This visualization function generates an illustrative display highlighting the FIFO (First In, First Out) characteristic of queues, aiding users in comprehending the enqueue and dequeue operations visually.

By invoking visualize_queue(queue), users can observe the dynamic nature of queues, enhancing their understanding of how elements are added and removed in a sequential manner.
